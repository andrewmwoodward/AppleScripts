#Applesripts

A collection of AppleScripts mainly used for manipulation/analysis of data collected while working at Rehab Neuro Lab.
Some of these functions could be achieved with Excel macros but output data in the form of txt files often was often needed to be organized
so AppleScripts provided a simple solution.
